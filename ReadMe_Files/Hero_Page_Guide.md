# Hero Page — Complete Guide

## Priority Chain (Automatic)

The website checks for files in this order and loads the first one found:

```
1. festival.jpg exists?        → Festival Mode (swaps image)
        ↓ (not found)
2. hero-video.mp4 FILE exists? → Try Video Mode (swaps to video)
        ↓ (video plays)        → Video Mode
        ↓ (slow/blocked)       → Stays on hero-default.jpg (Normal Mode)
        ↓ (file not found)
3. hero-default.jpg            → Already loaded from HTML (instant, no delay)
```

## How to Use Each Mode

### I want a VIDEO hero
1. Create/download video (1920x1080, under 5MB, 5-8 sec, no audio)
2. Save as `assets/hero-video.mp4`
3. Also upload a still image as `assets/hero.jpg` (video fallback for slow internet)
4. Push to GitHub
5. Website auto-plays video. If video is slow, shows `hero.jpg` after 10 sec.

### I want a FESTIVAL banner
1. Generate banner from Gemini/ChatGPT (1920x1080, landscape)
2. Save as `assets/festival.jpg`
3. Push to GitHub
4. Website shows festival banner (overrides video and everything else)

### Festival is over — remove banner
1. Delete `assets/festival.jpg` from GitHub
2. Website auto-falls back to video → hero.jpg → hero-default.jpg

### I want just a STATIC IMAGE (no video)
1. Delete `assets/hero-video.mp4` from GitHub (if exists)
2. Upload your image as `assets/hero.jpg` (if it has text baked in)
3. Or just let it fall back to `hero-default.jpg` (Taj Mahal + website text)

### I want to change the DEFAULT hero image
1. Replace `assets/hero-default.jpg` with your new photo
2. This is the final fallback — always present, always works
3. Website shows "Explore All of India With Us" text overlay on top

## Fallback Timeline

```
Page loads
    ↓
hero-default.jpg starts loading immediately (from HTML src)
    ↓
Normal mode applied → user sees temple image instantly
    ↓
Check festival.jpg ──── found? ──→ Swap to festival banner
    ↓ (not found)
Check hero-video.mp4 FILE exists? (HEAD request)
    ↓
    ├── File exists:
    │     ├── Video plays in < 10 sec ──→ Swap to video
    │     ├── Video autoplay blocked ──→ Stay on hero-default
    │     └── 10 seconds pass, no video ──→ Stay on hero-default
    │
    └── File NOT found (404):
